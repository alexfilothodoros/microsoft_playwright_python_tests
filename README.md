# microsoft_playwright_python_tests
Some python playwright tests, set to be run with pytest.
The tests check various scenarios at http://www.uitestingplayground.com .

More tests and more assertions will be added in the future.
There is a pytest.ini file that sets the base_url for the tests.
Maybe, in the future, this will be base_url will be not fixed, as there are more sites for practising test automation.
